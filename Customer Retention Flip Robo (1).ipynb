    "A case study from Indian e-commerce customers\n",
    "Customer satisfaction has emerged as one of the most important factors that guarantee the success of online store; it has been posited as a key stimulant of purchase or repurchase intentions and customer loyalty. A comprehensive review of the literature, theories and models have been carried out to propose the models for customer activation and customer retention. Five major factors that contributed to the success of an e-commerce store have been identified as: service quality, system quality, information quality, trust and net benefit. The research furthermore investigated the factors that influence the online customers repeat purchase intention. The combination of both utilitarian value and hedonistic values are needed to affect the repeat purchase intention (loyalty) positively. The data is collected from the Indian online shoppers."

The data explained how the online platform has been used more often in which CITY,PIN CODE, AGE GROUP, etc. It also showed that in some factors there is less importance given to contribute to the success of an e-commerce store, so based on that we could remove those factors & keep all the important factors, also we could improve on some factors that influence the online customers repeat purchase intention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the first 47 features, the rest of the features showed which online platform has been used more based on the success factors. Based on the case study for customer activation & retention, Amazon is most reliable and has been fulfilled the customer requirements. After Amazon, data showed Flipkart has been used more for online shopping.\n",
    "The case study from Indian e-commerce customers showed Amazon and Flipkart has been used mostly for Online Shopping and most recommended by Friends. So, based on the research factors, Amazon & Flipkart are the e-commerce platform, which are having the combination of both utilitarian and hedonistic values to keep the repeat purchase intention (loyalty) positively."
